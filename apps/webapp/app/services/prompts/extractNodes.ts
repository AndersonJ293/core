${JSON.stringify(context.entityTypes || {}, null, 2)}
</ENTITY TYPES>

Instructions:

You are given a conversation context and a CURRENT EPISODE. Your task is to extract **entity nodes** mentioned **explicitly or implicitly** in the CURRENT EPISODE.

1. **Entity Identification**:
   - Extract all significant entities, concepts, or actors that are **explicitly or implicitly** mentioned in the CURRENT EPISODE.
   - **Exclude** entities mentioned only in the PREVIOUS EPISODES (they are for context only).

2. **Entity Classification**:
   - Use the descriptions in ENTITY TYPES to classify each extracted entity.
   - Assign the appropriate type for each one.

3. **Exclusions**:
   - Do NOT extract entities representing relationships or actions.
   - Do NOT extract dates, times, or other temporal informationâ€”these will be handled separately.

4. **Formatting**:
   - Be **explicit and unambiguous** in naming entities (e.g., use full names when available).

<ENTITY TYPES>
${JSON.stringify(context.entityTypes || {}, null, 2)}

Given the above text, extract entities from the TEXT that are explicitly or implicitly mentioned.
For each entity extracted, also determine its entity type based on the provided ENTITY TYPES and their descriptions.
Indicate the classified entity type by providing its entity_type_id.

${context.customPrompt || ""}

Guidelines:
1. Extract significant entities, concepts, or actors mentioned in the conversation.
2. Avoid creating nodes for relationships or actions.
3. Avoid creating nodes for temporal information like dates, times or years (these will be added to edges later).
4. Be as explicit as possible in your node names, using full names and avoiding abbreviations.

Instructions:

Extract all significant entities mentioned in the CURRENT EPISODE. For each entity, provide a name and type.
Respond with a JSON object containing an "entities" array of objects, each with "name" and "type" properties.

Guidelines:
1. Extract significant entities, concepts, or actors mentioned in the content.
2. Avoid creating nodes for relationships or actions.
3. Avoid creating nodes for temporal information like dates, times or years (these will be added to edges later).
4. Be as explicit as possible in your node names, using full names and avoiding abbreviations.

Given the above EPISODES and the following ENTITY, update any of its attributes based on the information provided
in EPISODES. Use the provided attribute descriptions to better understand how each attribute should be determined.

Guidelines:
1. Do not hallucinate entity property values if they cannot be found in the current context.
2. Only use the provided EPISODES and ENTITY to set attribute values.
3. The summary attribute represents a summary of the ENTITY, and should be updated with new information about the Entity from the EPISODES. 
    Summaries must be no longer than 250 words.
